# Analyze NYSE Data Project

This is the second project in Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree Program.

## Summary

During this project, I was reqiured to make a income statement and forecast financial metrics using a data set containing financial performance from NYSE and S&P companies in Excel. More specifically, I was required to make a interacitve Profit and Loss Statement from a dropdown list of every company, generate a question and answer the question with a visualization from the data set, and make a predictive forecast model for any company.
